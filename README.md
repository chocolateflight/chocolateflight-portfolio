### What I learned

I'm writing this text on February 20, 2023. Due to various private and school events, my journey to teach myself web development unfortunately stalled a bit in the last few weeks. While creating this rather simple project I realized how important it is to repeat things so that you don't forget them. At the same time, I also learned new things, like how to use Next.js 13.
